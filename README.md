# shell-scripts
This is a place for scripts I write for the Unix shell to make it easier to use.

## psubs.sh
This script prints out the names of all subdirectories in the current working directory. I use this all the time for cd'ing around. To use it, simply put this file in your main directory, then type ~/psubs.sh in the terminal and it will print the names of all subdirectories in your current directory.
